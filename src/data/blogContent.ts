      <p>Cloud-native architecture represents a fundamental shift in how we design, build, and operate applications. This approach leverages cloud computing capabilities to create resilient, scalable, and maintainable systems.</p>

      <h2>Cloud-Native Principles</h2>
      
      <h3>Microservices Architecture</h3>
      <p>Break applications into small, independently deployable services that communicate through well-defined APIs. This enables teams to develop, deploy, and scale services independently.</p>
      
      <h3>Containerization</h3>
      <p>Package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently across different environments.</p>
      
      <h3>Dynamic Orchestration</h3>
      <p>Use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to automatically manage application deployment, scaling, and lifecycle.</p>
      
      <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
      
      <h3>API Gateway Pattern</h3>
      <p>Implement a single entry point for client requests that routes to appropriate microservices, handles authentication, and provides cross-cutting concerns.</p>
      
      <h3>Circuit Breaker Pattern</h3>
      <p>Prevent cascading failures by monitoring service calls and failing fast when downstream services are unavailable.</p>
      
      <h3>Saga Pattern</h3>
      <p>Manage distributed transactions across microservices through a series of compensating actions rather than traditional ACID transactions.</p>
      
      <h3>Event Sourcing</h3>
      <p>Store application state as a sequence of events rather than current state snapshots, enabling audit trails and temporal queries.</p>
      
      <h2>Serverless Computing</h2>
      
      <h3>Function as a Service (FaaS)</h3>
      <p>Deploy individual functions that respond to events without managing server infrastructure. Scale automatically based on demand.</p>
      
      <h3>Event-Driven Architecture</h3>
      <p>Build systems that react to events in real-time, enabling loose coupling and high responsiveness.</p>
      
      <h2>Data Management Strategies</h2>
      
      <h3>Database per Service</h3>
      <p>Each microservice owns its data and database schema, preventing tight coupling through shared databases.</p>
      
      <h3>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)</h3>
      <p>Separate read and write operations to optimize for different access patterns and performance requirements.</p>
      
      <h2>Observability and Monitoring</h2>
      
      <h3>Distributed Tracing</h3>
      <p>Track requests across multiple services to understand system behavior and identify performance bottlenecks.</p>
      
      <h3>Metrics and Logging</h3>
      <p>Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to maintain visibility into distributed system health.</p>
      
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero-trust security model with service-to-service authentication</li>
        <li>Secrets management and encryption at rest and in transit</li>
        <li>Network segmentation and least privilege access</li>
        <li>Container and runtime security scanning</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Adopting cloud-native architecture requires organizational changes, new skills, and different operational practices, but provides significant benefits in scalability, resilience, and development velocity.</p>
